    " \n",
    "Human brain is composed of 86 billion nerve cells called neurons. Neurons are 'attached' to each other by synapses (axons), structures that allow them to electrically and chemically communicate with each other. Stimuli from external environment are accepted by dendrites. These inputs create electric impulses, which quickly travel through the neural network. A neuron can then send the message to other neuron, or does not send it.\n",
